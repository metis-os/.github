**_I know what you guys have been thinking, but I guess it was supposed to
be_** :( 

It is with a mix of pride and a bit of sadness that I announce the deprecation
and discontinuation of the MetisLinux project. As of today, MetisLinux will no
longer be maintained !

This project started as a fun way for me to learn the ins and outs of the Linux
operating system. It's been an incredible journey, and I've learned so much
along the way. I wanted to create a lightweight, customizable distro that was
both a learning tool and a practical OS. It‚Äôs been a great experience, and I‚Äôm
proud of what we‚Äôve accomplished together.

Before I started college, the time management for the project was perfect. I
was able to dedicate ample time to developing and maintaining MetisLinux.
However, since I joined university, my schedule has become quite hectic.
Balancing academic responsibilities with this project has become increasingly
challenging.

I have to give a huge shoutout to [**Dylan
Araps**](https://github.com/dylanaraps) for all the inspiration üôè . His projects
and contributions to the open-source community have been a big motivation for
me.

To everyone who was involved in MetisLinux, whether you contributed code,
reported bugs, shared feedback, or just used it, thank you! Your support has
meant the world to me, and I couldn‚Äôt have done it without you.

### Moving Forward

Even though MetisLinux won't get any more updates, everything we've done is
still out here for you to use. Since the project is [**licensed under MIT**](https://opensource.org/license/mit), all the
code, resources, and tools are free for you to use and build on. Feel free to
fork it, learn from it, or create something new with it.

I hope the skills and knowledge gained from this project will continue to
benefit you all. The open-source community is full of amazing opportunities,
and I can‚Äôt wait to see what you all come up with next.

**Cheers,**
